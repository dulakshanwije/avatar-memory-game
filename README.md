# Flip Card Memory Game Using ReactJS!

A few weeks ago, I read an article on a website listing the top 5 React front-end projects for beginners. A flip card game was one of them, so I decided to develop my own.

I chose one of my favorite TV shows, Netflix's Avatar: The Last Airbender, as the theme. I hope you'll enjoy playing it!

Through this project, I gained a strong understanding of React components, custom styling, state management, hooks, and more. I also made the game responsive for smaller screens.

I'd love to hear your feedback on this project!

Scrimba, W3Schools.com, freeCodeCamp, and many YouTube videos have been instrumental in my ReactJS learning journey so far. I'm excited to continue diving deeper into these resources!
